    <!-- Absolute Links
    Links to pages on other websites on the internet are called absolute links. A typical absolute link will be made up of the following parts: protocol://domain/path. An absolute link will always contain the protocol and domain of the destination.
    
    We’ve already seen an absolute link in action. The link we created to The Odin Project’s About page earlier was an absolute link as it contains the protocol and domain.

    <!-- Absolute and Relative Links -->


    <!-- Relative Links
    Links to other pages within our own website are called relative links. 
    Relative links do not include the domain name, since it is another page on the same site, 
    it assumes the domain name will be the same as the page we created the link on. -->
